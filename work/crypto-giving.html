        <h5>Crypto Giving</h5>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In <b>December 2024</b>, <b>JustGiving</b> became the <b>first UK platform</b> to launch crypto donations, expanding the feature to the <b>US in March 2025</b>.</p>
        <p>This was a major milestone for the company, giving people a new, tax-efficient way to support the causes they care about.</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The idea of introducing crypto donations had been floating around at JustGiving for quite some time. But before we could make it happen, there were plenty of complex technical and legal challenges to solve.</p>
        <p>In <b>2024</b>, the <b>crypto market's total capitalization nearly doubled, increasing by 96.2%</b>. That same year, we also began discussions with <b>The Giving Block</b>—a company that provides an API for handling crypto payments. Integrating their solution into JustGiving's checkout was a promising path forward.</p>
        <p>Of course, this wouldn't solve everything. There were still major hurdles to overcome. But we saw an opportunity to finally dive into the project and explore what crypto donations could look like for JustGiving.</p>
    
        <h2>Opportunity</h2>
        <p>Typically, crypto assets need to be liquidated before they can be donated. That means converting them to fiat currency, paying taxes on the gains, and only then making the donation.</p>
        <p><b>This process isn’t tax-efficient at all.</b></p>
        <p>Donors want a way to give without losing a big chunk to taxes beforehand. Charities want that too—because, on average, it means they <b>can receive up to 20% more from each donation</b>.</p>
    <p>We saw a big opportunity to <b></b>give donors a more tax-efficient way to give</b> while also driving a <b>major boost in JustGiving’s revenue</b>.</p>
