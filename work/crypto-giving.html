        <h5>Crypto Giving</h5>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In <b>December 2024</b>, <b>JustGiving</b> became the <b>first UK platform</b> to launch crypto donations, expanding the feature to the <b>US in March 2025.</b></p>
        <p>This was a major milestone for the company, giving people a new, tax-efficient way to support the causes they care about.</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The idea of introducing crypto donations had been floating around at JustGiving for quite some time. But before we could make it happen, there were plenty of complex technical and legal challenges to solve.</p>
        <p>In early 2024, we saw crypto adoption rising worldwide. Around that time, we also began discussions with The Giving Blockâ€”a company that provides an API for handling crypto payments. Integrating their solution into JustGiving's checkout was a promising path forward.</p>
        <p>Of course, this wouldn't solve everything. There were still major hurdles to overcome. But we saw an opportunity to finally dive into the project and explore what crypto donations could look like for JustGiving.</p>
